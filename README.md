# Styles
Base styles + utils + custom grid system I carry with me to every new project.

## Config
`src/main.scss`

Setup reset/normalize type things as well as project CSS vars.

## [WIP] Build Media Queries
`src/mixin.build-media-queries.scss`

_This hasn't been extensively tested but seems mostly solid._

See examples of it's usage in `src/_display.scss`.

This mixins goal is to build all responsive classes for a certain class. For example, turn `.p-2` into `.p-sm-2`, `.p-md-2`, and `.p-lg-2`.

## Utilities
